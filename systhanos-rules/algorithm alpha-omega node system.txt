You want an algorithm for the Alpha-Omega Node System. I'll provide a high-level algorithmic outline for each component, focusing on their core functions and interactions as described in your document.-----Alpha Node Algorithm

Goal: Create, command, and initiate Agents.

Variables:
`active_agents`: A dictionary/database mapping `agent_id` to `agent_metadata` (e.g., task, status, creation_timestamp).
`agent_counter`: An integer to generate unique `agent_id`s.
Algorithm:
Initialize:
Set `agent_counter = 0`.
Initialize `active_agents` as empty.
`create_agent(task_description, priority=None, expiry=None)` Function:
Increment `agent_counter`.
Generate `agent_id = f"Agent-{agent_counter}"`.
Create `agent_metadata = { "id": agent_id, "task": task_description, "priority": priority, "expiry": expiry, "status": "PENDING_LAUNCH", "alpha_origin": "true" }`.
Store `agent_metadata` in `active_agents[agent_id]`.
Action: Launch the Agent (e.g., via Docker command, subprocess, or message to a task queue).
Pass `agent_metadata` as configuration to the launched Agent.
Update `active_agents[agent_id]["status"] = "LAUNCHED"`.
Log: "Alpha Node launched Agent `agent_id` for task: `task_description`."
Return `agent_id`.
`monitor_agents()` Function (runs continuously/periodically):
Action: Periodically check `active_agents` for agent status updates (e.g., from Omega reports, or via external monitoring).
Action: If an Agent is reported by Omega as "COMPLETED," "ARCHIVED," "RECYCLED," or "DESTROYED," remove it from `active_agents`.
`receive_omega_feedback(feedback_data)` Function (optional, for Meta Layer):
Process `feedback_data` (e.g., performance metrics, common failures, task completion rates).
Action: Adjust future `create_agent` parameters or policies based on feedback (e.g., prioritize certain tasks, modify agent resource allocation).
-----Agent Algorithm

Goal: Execute assigned tasks and report to Omega.

Variables:
`agent_metadata`: Received from Alpha (e.g., `id`, `task`, `priority`, `expiry`, `alpha_origin`).
`task_status`: Current status of the task (e.g., "INITIALIZED", "IN_PROGRESS", "COMPLETED", "FAILED").
`task_result`: Data generated by the task.
Algorithm:
Initialize (on launch):
Receive `agent_metadata`.
Set `task_status = "INITIALIZED"`.
Log: "Agent `agent_metadata.id` initialized with task: `agent_metadata.task`."
`execute_task()` Function:
Set `task_status = "IN_PROGRESS"`.
Log: "Agent `agent_metadata.id` starting task execution."
Core Task Logic:
Perform actions based on `agent_metadata.task` (e.g., "Index .epub files," "Process data," "Fetch API").
Handle potential errors or exceptions.
If task completes successfully:
Set `task_status = "COMPLETED"`.
Store any relevant output in `task_result`.
Log: "Agent `agent_metadata.id` task completed successfully."
If task fails:
Set `task_status = "FAILED"`.
Store error details in `task_result`.
Log: "Agent `agent_metadata.id` task failed."
`report_to_omega()` Function:
Construct `report_payload = { "agent_id": agent_metadata.id, "task_status": task_status, "task_result": task_result, "completion_timestamp": current_timestamp }`.
Action: Send `report_payload` to the Omega Node (e.g., via gRPC call, message queue publish).
Log: "Agent `agent_metadata.id` reported `task_status` to Omega."
Agent Lifecycle Management (after reporting):
Action: Await a signal from Omega.
If Omega signals "RECYCLE":
Receive new `agent_metadata` (e.g., new task).
Re-initialize with new task and restart `execute_task()`.
If Omega signals "TERMINATE" or "DESTROY":
Action: Self-terminate (e.g., exit process/container).
Log: "Agent `agent_metadata.id` received termination signal and is shutting down."
If no explicit signal, or a default "ARCHIVE" signal:
Action: Self-terminate after reporting.
Log: "Agent `agent_metadata.id` completed its mission and is shutting down."
-----Omega Node Algorithm

Goal: Observe, archive, judge, and resolve Agent lifecycles.

Variables:
`agent_reports`: A database/queue for incoming reports from Agents.
`archived_agents`: A database for completed/archived agent logs and results.
`policies`: Rules for agent disposition (archive, recycle, destroy) based on `task_status`, `priority`, etc.
Algorithm:
Initialize:
Initialize `agent_reports` and `archived_agents`.
Define `policies` (e.g., "If task_status is FAILED, destroy. If COMPLETED, archive. If high_priority, recycle if possible.").
`receive_agent_report(report_payload)` Function (triggered by incoming Agent reports):
Store `report_payload` in `agent_reports`.
Extract `agent_id`, `task_status`, `task_result`.
Log: "Omega received report from Agent `agent_id`. Status: `task_status`."
`process_agent_report(report_payload)` Function (triggered after receiving report, or by a continuous processing loop):
Retrieve `agent_id`, `task_status`, `task_result`, and any other relevant `agent_metadata` (if needed from Alpha).
Action: Log `report_payload` to `archived_agents` for historical record.
Decision Logic (based on `policies`):
If `task_status == "COMPLETED"`:
Action: Decide: "ARCHIVE", "RECYCLE", or "DESTROY".
If "ARCHIVE":
Send "ARCHIVE" signal/message to Agent `agent_id` (implicitly leading to self-termination).
Log: "Omega decided to archive Agent `agent_id`."
If "RECYCLE":
Action: Generate `new_task` for `agent_id`.
Send "RECYCLE" signal with `new_task` to Agent `agent_id`.
Log: "Omega decided to recycle Agent `agent_id` with new task: `new_task`."
If "DESTROY":
Send "DESTROY" signal/message to Agent `agent_id`.
Action: If possible, actively terminate/kill the Agent process/container.
Log: "Omega decided to destroy Agent `agent_id`."
If `task_status == "FAILED"`:
Action: Decide: "DESTROY" (and log failure), or "RETRY" (with a new agent or recycling the current one).
If "DESTROY":
Send "DESTROY" signal/message. Actively terminate.
Log: "Omega decided to destroy FAILED Agent `agent_id`."
If "RETRY":
Action: Inform Alpha to create a new Agent for the failed task, or send a "RECYCLE" signal with a retry attempt to the current agent.
Log: "Omega detected failure for Agent `agent_id` and initiated retry."
Else (e.g., unexpected status):
Log: "Omega received unexpected status `task_status` from Agent `agent_id`. Archiving by default."
Send "ARCHIVE" signal.
